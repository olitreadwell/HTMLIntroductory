Hello and welcome to the introduction to HTML5 and CSS. This course is meant for people who have little to no knowledge about HTML or CSS and want to learn how to build webpages.

In this course we are going to use GitHub and GitHub Desktop to interact wit repositories. We will cover HTML from the ground up, from what is a tag or an element, how to use the new HTML5 semantic elements, and what HTML is meant for. Then we will move to CSS. We will learn what CSS allows us to do to the HTML in terms of presentation and layout. Finally we are going to learn how to implement Bootstrap, one of the most used frameworks. We will use this framework to complete a final project - a responsive webpage.
