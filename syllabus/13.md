#  Instruction Plan

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. It aims to ease the development of dynamic websites and web applications.

Visit one the following websites and play with the size of your browser to see it change accordingly

### Include Bootstrap into webpage

To get started, download the [zip file](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v3.3.5/bootstrap-3.3.5-dist.zip). This zip file has 3 folders: CSS, js, and fonts.

![Bootstrap folders](../images/13/bootstrap-folders.jpg)

Inside the CSS folder you will find six files, but we will only use `bootstrap.min.css`.

![Bootstrap minify css file](../images/13/bootstrap-min-css.jpg)

Inside the js folder you will find 3 files, but we will only use `bootstrap.min.js`.

We are not going to use the fonts but if you wish to know more, visit this [page](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons).

All you have to do is copy those files into your project's css and js folder.

### Grid system

Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns according to the screen size. Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that holds the content.

We will be making three distinctions: phone(sx), tablet(sm), and laptop(md). Now since we have 12 columns in our grid, we can make several combinations that add up to 12, for example:

```html
<!-- It is important to have a column combination encapsulated within a row to perform well -->
<!-- This will result in 3 columns. First one is 4 column, second 2 column, and third 6 column wide -->
<!-- The total of these columns adds up to 12 -->
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        This is 4 columns wide
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-2">
        This is 2 columns wide
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
        This is 6 columns wide
    </div>
</div>
```

By determining the number of columns for a specific screen size, all the other screen sizes bigger than the one described will inherit that size and all the smaller sized screens will be default to a 12 column width. When you define a container element like a `div` with `class=col-sm-4`, you are setting a container 4 columns wide for small, medium, and large screen sizes and for extra small screens, it will be 12 columns wide or full width.
