# Instruction Plan

### Cascade

CSS uses a mechanism called the `cascade` to resolve any such conflicts and arrive at a final set of styles to be applied to the document. Two key components of the cascade are `inheritance` and `specificty`.

**Inheritance** - The elements on your website make up a treelike hierarchy with the root element at the top and the rest of the document structure spreading down below it. 

**Specificity** - Describes the weight of a selector and any declarations associated with it.

<table>
        <tr>
            <th>Selector type</th>
            <th>Example</th>
            <th>Specificity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Universal Selector</td>
            <td>*</td>
            <td>0,0,0,0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Type Selector</td>
            <td>div</td>
            <td>0,0,0,1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Class Selector</td>
            <td>.luigi</td>
            <td>0,0,1,0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ID selector</td>
            <td>#mario</td>
            <td>0,1,0,0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Inline</td>
            <td>style="color:#ccc;"</td>
            <td>1,0,0,0</td>
        </tr>
</table>

Specificity values are cumulative. A selector containing two type selector and a class selector `div.action p` has a specificity of (0,0,1,2).
A selector containing 11 type selector (0,0,0,11) has a lower specificity than a class selector (0,0,1,0).


**Last Rule** - When selectors have the same weight the last rule is applied.

#### Exercises

Use `type selector` and `inheritance` to manipulate the paragraph.

```html
<section>
    <div>
        <p>Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.</p>
    </div>
</section>
```

Calculate the specificity fo the following selector

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Selector</th>
        <th>Specificity</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>*.hulk a</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>header#thor div .links li</td><td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>#ant-man section article h1</td><td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.iron-man .stark aside  p</td><td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td>footer.spider-man p#title div link</td><td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a style="text-decoration:none">My Link</a></td><td></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Take a look to the following code and determine what color is the paragraph going to be.

```html
<style>

    article #text {
        color: #aaa;
    }
    
    article div .expression {
        color: #ccc;
    }
    
    div p#text {
        color: #0f0;
    }
</style>
<article>
    <div>
        <p id="text" class="expression">A general rule of thumb when declaring your css is to declare properties with the least specificity needed to style your elements.</p>
    </div>
</article>
```

### CSS Selectors

**Descendant Selector** - Matches an element that is a descendant of another specified element. This applies to all level of descendant.

```css
    body h1 {
        /*declarations*/
    }
    
    section .warning p {
        /*declarations*/
    }
```

**Child Selector** - Matches an element that is a direct child of another. It will not include grandchild and down. It is more restrictive than descendant selector

```css
    body > h1 {
        /*declarations*/
    }
    
    section > .warning {
        /*declarations*/
    }
```

**Pseudo-class Selector** - It is used to define a special state of an element. There are many Pseudo-classes available. Let's take a look to some of the most common used: first-child/last-child, hover, nth-child(n), and visited.

```css
    a.bowser:hover {
        /*declarations*/
    }
    
    article h2:first-child {
        /*declarations*/
    }
    
    section#kirby div:nth-child(2) {
         /*declarations*/
    }
```

### Evaluate

Make the paragraph and list items to have a color #9934df, font weight as bold, and font size 3 em using `Inheritance`.

```html
<section>
    <p>PlayStation consoles</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PlayStation 1 - 1995</li>
        <li>PlayStation 2 - 2000</li>
        <li>PlayStation 3 - 2006</li>
        <li>PlayStation 4 - 2013</li>
    </ul>
</section>
```

Arrange the following in order from most specific to least specific.

`.my_div, div, #my_navigation, div > div`

How can you improve this snippet?

```html
    <!-- Make sure this CSS code goes in a external file inside a css folder -->
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: #ccc;
        }
        
        p {
            color: #ccc;
        }
    </style>
    
    <aside>
        <h1>Introducing Brotli: a new compression algorithm for the internet</h1>
        <div>
            <p>At Google, we think that internet users’ time is valuable, and that they shouldn’t have to wait long for a web page to load. Because fast is better than slow, two years ago we published the Zopfli compression algorithm. This received such positive feedback in the industry that it has been integrated into many compression solutions, ranging from PNG optimizers to preprocessing web content. Based on its use and other modern compression needs, such as web font compression, today we are excited to announce that we have developed and open sourced a new algorithm, the Brotli compression algorithm.</p>
            <p>While Zopfli is Deflate-compatible, Brotli is a whole new data format. This new format allows us to get 20–26% higher compression ratios over Zopfli. In our study ‘Comparison of Brotli, Deflate, Zopfli, LZMA, LZHAM and Bzip2 Compression Algorithms’ we show that Brotli is roughly as fast as zlib’s Deflate implementation. At the same time, it compresses slightly more densely than LZMA and bzip2 on the Canterbury corpus. The higher data density is achieved by a 2nd order context modeling, re-use of entropy codes, larger memory window of past data and joint distribution codes. Just like Zopfli, the new algorithm is named after Swiss bakery products. Brötli means ‘small bread’ in Swiss German.</p>
        </div>
    </aside>

### Homework

Oh no, someone messed with my code! Please help me out to get it back the way it was before. Gladly they didn't make any changes to my HTML, but my CSS is broken. Please, help me.

This is how it should look once you have it all fixed.
