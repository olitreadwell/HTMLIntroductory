# HTML5 - Semantic Elements

### Objective

* In today's class, you will review HTML concept and structure your website to be semantically correct
* Will also explore the difference between using Semantic elements and div containers

### Pre-Reading

* [Semantic HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)
* [W3School -  Semantic HTML5](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
* [HTML5 semantic elements](http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/html5-semantic-elements/)
* [HTML5 semantics](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/html5-semantics/)

# Today's Project

You will work with your parter to complete the following program. You must follow these steps.
* 1. Discuss ideas for the project
* 2. Sketching out a visual representation of what will be built
* 3. Using one computer, one person will type and the other will tell him or her what to type (this is called peer programming)
* 4. At a reasonable time, switch spots
* 5. Once your project is complete, upload a link to it on your github.io page. It should be titled "Project 1: Daily Planet".

# Let's get started!

You've been hired to build the landing page for the Daily Planet newspaper. You will be working alongside with a designer that **already** worked on the CSS. Make sure you have the following elements on your page:

* header
* nav
* main
* section
* article
* aside
* footer

*Class Discussion / presentations (time permitting)*

### Homework pt 1

Oh no! We missed an email from the designer at Daily Planet. SHe told me that the web page structure is the following

![HTML5 Structure](../images/02/homework.jpg)

Instructions:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Area</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Header</td>
        <td>Needs to say "Daily Planet" in big letter using an h1.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Navigation</td>
        <td>Links to 3 different sections -Sports, Local, Economy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Article</td>
        <td>Most recent news you feel is important, include a picture.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Aside</td>
        <td>We neeed to sponsor. Pick whichever like most.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Footer</td>
        <td>Add copyright of the company and the current year.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Please edit your Daily Planet project to meet these requirements and link it to your github.io entitled "Daily Planet 2.0"

### Homework pt 2

There was a miscommunication in our team, the developer that was working on the HTML part of the project created a website not using semantic elements, but the designer that worked on the CSS file did work using semantic type selectors. Now the website doesn't look the way it should. Please help us out!

I've attached our website to this [link](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/HTMLIntroductory/raw/master/archives/02/hands-on/git-scm.zip)

Once you complete your project, link it to your github.io page and entitle it "Day 2 Homework".



































# Instruction Plan 

### Sematic elements

Elements that clearly describe its meaning to both the browser and the developer. One of the benefits of writing HTML semantically is that it's easy-to-use. The use of HTML elements gives the developer the possibility of writing fewer attributes and avoiding inline styles. All of this makes your code less clumsy. If some developer has to read or edit your code, they will have an easy interaction with it since they won't waste time on trying to figure out how it works. Plus, your code will be condensed, thereby making the file load faster.

Example of a web page not using semantic element

```html
<div id="main">
    <div id="section">
        <div id="article"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="aside"></div>
</div>
<div id="footer">
</div>
```
Example of a web page using semantic elements

```html
<main>
    <section>
        <article></article>
    </section>
    <aside></aside>
</main>
<footer>
</footer>
```
### Other benefits

Many of us only consume the web through the web browser, but there is a portion of the world that does not. Many use screen readers, monochrome screens, need to print the page, or another accommodation. In those cases it not so much how the content is presented but how it is structured. Imagine a website without having CSS styling and know that the page is still understood by other computer program consuming the HTML page. 

```html
<p>Lorem <b>ipsum</b> dolor sit <i>amet.</i></p>
```
```html
<p>Lorem <strong>ipsum</strong> dolor sit <em>amet.</em></p>
```
