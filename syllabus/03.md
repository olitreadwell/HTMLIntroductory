# Instruction Plan

#### CSS Anatomy

![CSS Anatomy](../images/03/css-rule-anatomy.jpg)

CSS needs three components to work, a selector, properties and value. The `selector` will tell CSS what is going to be changed. The `declaration` tells what `properties` are going to change and the `value` tells to what is going to change.

**Example**

```html
<style>
    p {
    font-size: 20px;
    color: blue;
}
</style>

<p>This paragraph by the above rule, it has been giving 20 pixels size and blue color.</p>
```

There are three ways to write CSS for a webpage. We have `inline style`, `embedded styling`, and `external stylesheet`. Let's take a look to each one of them and see which one is the best solution for us.

#### Inline style
Basically this involves adding an attribute `style` with `declarations` as values. This way of writing CSS does not require a `selector`.

```html
<section style="width: 500px; height: 256px; background:#ccc;">
    Sections work just like div but they have semantic meaning
</section>
```

#### Embedded Styling
It is done by adding a `<style>` element preferably within the `<head>` element. Inside `<style>` CSS rules can be written.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Adding CSS using style element</title>
        <style>
            h1 {
                text-decoration: underline;
                font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>
            The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser.
        </h1>
    </body>
</html>

```

#### External Style Sheet

This is the most common way of integrating CSS since it can be shared with several HTML pages and one change can affect all pages that use it, thereby reducing time and cost of maintenance. Another key advantage is that external sheet are cached, which can help reduce bandwidth usage.

```html
<head>
    <title>Awesome website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/css-file.css">
</head>
```

### CSS Selectors

In a CSS rule the select determins what element or elemets are going to be affected. The three major selector we will cover today is `type selector`, `id selector`, and `class selector`.

#### Type Selector

The `type selector` matches the element name used on HTML minus the `< >`. By writing one selector, you change the styling for every element within the page. Keep this in mind because it wil style everything, it doesn't targets a specific instance. Type selector are mostly used for general site-wide styling.

```html
<a href="#">link</a>
``` 

```css
a {
   text-decoration: none;
}

```

#### Id selector

`Id` selector is used for unique elements which mean that the `id` should only be used **one time** per page. Simply add an id `attribute` and a value. 

```html
<div id="mario"></div>
```

```css
#mario { 
    color: red;
}

```

#### Class selector

And finally the `class` selector is very similar to the `id` selector, but `class` can be shared with more elements. You can apply classes multiple times on a page to any element you want.

```html
<div class="luigi"></div>
<!-- more html -->
<section class="luigi"></section>
```

```css
.luigi { 
    color: green;
}
```

### Exercise

Copy the following code:

```html
<div>
    <h1>Create a standout resume in minutes</h1>
    <p>Whether itâ€™s a mind-blowing web portfolio or a professional PDF resume, <a href="https://www.visualcv.com/" target="_parent" >VisualCV</a> has the right design for the job.</p>

    <p>Every VisualCV template is carefully crafted to beat the 6 second test - helping you get from application to interview.
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.visualcv.com/www-home/img/cv-examples/more-samples.jpg" alt="Resumes">
</div>
```
Modify the elements using the following instructions:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Element</th>
        <th>Style</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>div</td>
        <td>80% wide, background color rgb(35, 52, 97), and center all content </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>h1</td>
        <td>Bold text, underline, and all caps</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>p</td>
        <td>Line height of 14.5 pixels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>a</td>
        <td>remove underline, and make it bold</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>image</td>
        <td>resize to 50%</td>
    </tr>
</table>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>paragraph</td>
        <td>font color #555 and padding bottom of 20 pixels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>read more</td>
        <td>Bold, color #252b3b, border of 2 pixels solid #555, padding all around 5 pixels, and no underline</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Homework

Intel want us to build one of the webpages. The designer already send the layout of how it should look like and add a zip file with the images and a text file with the content.

[Download zip file](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/HTMLIntroductory/raw/master/archives/03/homework/homework.zip)

And here is how it should look like:
