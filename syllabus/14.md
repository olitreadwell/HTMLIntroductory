# Instruction Plan


The nice thing about the classes Bootstrap implement is the naming. The name of the classes are self-explenatory. If we look at `Responsive Utility` classes we can understand what is the purpose of it and these utility classes are for showing and hiding content by device via media query.

The use of this classes  will allow us to show or hide content/elements according the device specified. For example you can set a content/element to show only on a mobile phone and be hidden when the device is bigger or showing something only for big screens that is hidden for tablets/phones. You can use `.visible-*-*` or `.hidden-*-*` when the first `*` could be xs, sm, md, or lg which represents the size of the screen. The second `-*` allows you modify the element normal document flow - allowing to have it as `inline` or `block`.

### Elaborate

Download this [initial project](../exercises/14/financial.zip) and work with me during class. This financial institution is asking us to hide some information when their clients are viewing the website in a **mobile phone**. 

### Evaluate

Include an `iframe` of Google Map. That map can only be seen on mobile viewport using Responsive Utility. Go to [Google Map](http://www.google.com/maps), click on the left menu next to the search and click on `share or embed map`. Make sure the map is only viewed in **mobile phones**.
