# Instruction Plan

So far we have been able to get the content structured and the elements to look the way we want but we havent been able to change the way elements are organize on the page. So far everything is stack on top of another (`normal document flow`). That is because container elements (`div`, `section`, `footer`, etc) are block level elements.

Float allows to elements to be placed to the left or right of its containing block. What allow us to change the flow of the elements is a CSS property named `float` to either `right` or `left`. To return to the normal document flow for the rest of the elements is the use of the property `clear`. `clear` has three possible values `left`, `right`, and `both`.

### Float

```html
<style>
    .my-element {
        width: 300px;
        height: 600px;
        float: left;
    }
</style>

<section>
    <div class="my-element">
        <p>A float is a box that is shifted to the left or right on the current line.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-element">
        <p>
            Content flows down the right side of a left-floated 
            box and down the left side of a right-floated box.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>
```

#### Clear

```html
<style>
    div {
        width: 300px;
        height: 600px;
    }
    .my-element {
        float: left;
    }
    
    .my-news {
        clear: left;
    }
</style>

<section>
    <div class="my-element">
        <p>A float is a box that is shifted to the left or right on the current line.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-element">
        <p>
            Content flows down the right side of a left-floated box and down the left
            side of a right-floated box.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-news">
        <p>
            This weekend, when you look into the night sky you will be able to see a 
            blood red, larger-than-life moon projecting against the stars; the first 
            in more than 30 years.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>
```

With the use of float comes some side effects

**Container collapse**

It occurs when the parent element cannot see the children because they are removed from the normal document flow, so it collapses up until it finds an element that is part of the normal flow. If not, then it collapses entirely.

**Column collapse**

A column collapse happens when the floating element runs out of space from its parent container so that the element(s) will resume in another line.

### Exercises

#### Float

```css
html, body {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}
html {
	background: #ccc;
}
body {
	width: 600px;
	background: #fff;
	margin: 2em auto 2em;
}
div {
	margin-bottom: 1em;
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
}
.element1 {
	background: rgb(211, 206, 61);
}
.element2 {
	background: rgb(85, 66, 54);
}
.element3 {
	background: rgb(247,120,37);
}
```

```html
<p>The float property has four possible values: left | right | inherit | none<p>
<p>Floating an element to the left or to the right will cause it to move to the left-most or right-most edge of its parent container. Floating removes the element from normal flow, and will cause elements below it to shift accordingly.</p>
<div class="element1"></div>
<div class="element2"></div>
<div class="element3"></div>
```

#### Clear Fix

```css
html, body {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}
html {
	background: rgb(108,135,178);
}
body {
	width: 600px;
	background: #fff;
	margin: 0 auto;
	font: 90% Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
div {
	width: 50px;
	height: 50px;
	padding: 50px;
}
section {
	background: rgb(178,155,107);
	border: 1px solid black;
	padding: 10px;
}
.one {
	background: rgb(207, 255, 245);
}
.two {
	background: rgb(101,209,255);
}
.three {
	background: rgb(255, 231, 181);
}
```

```html
<section>
    <div class="one">One</div>
    <div class="two">Two</div>
    <div class="three">Three</div>
</section>
```
