# Hosting and File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

### Objective

* Login into CPanel and explore
* Use and create an FTP Account
* Upload files and folder to `PUBLIC_HTML` 


### CPanel

Most of the Linux hosting service providers offer the use of [cPanel ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPanel) as a tool designed to simplify the process of hosting a web site. In most cases you can access to cPanel by adding `cpanel` at the end of your domain like `http://www.mydomain.com/cpanel`. You credentials to access cPanel should arrive in an email from your hosting provider.

#### FTP

Before we can gain access to our hosting we need to install a FTP solution. There are many solutions out there but we are going to recommend two  of them. [Filezilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) (Windows) and [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io) (Mac/Windows).

One of sections within cPanel is called `Files`. There you can access your files and folder existing in your server under `File Manager` or use `FTP` to manipulate large amount of files and folders.

`FTP Accounts` will allow you to administrate accounts that can have access to your hosting. By default there is one FTP Account that matches the name you used to access cPanel, they are called `Special FTP Accounts`.

One easy way to get all you need to access your Hosting via FTP is by clicking `Configure FTP Client` under **Actions** then select the right FTP solution installed in your computer. That file contains your FTP username, FTP server, FTP port, and some other setting, but it will not have the password - for security reasons. The password is the same you used to login into cPanel.

> Be careful when using this FTP account - You will have access to other files and folders that are part of the server configuration.

The main focus here is to transfer your project that lives in your computer and move it over `public_html`. If `public_html` is not present look for the `www` folder
